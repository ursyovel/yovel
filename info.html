      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Mingsang, and I’m a passionate graphics designer from Nepal with intermediate-level experience.
        In addition to design, I also have skills in web development and 3D modeling. I'm also a guitar enthusiast and enjoy
        playing Nepali songs in my free time.
      </p>

      <h3>How I Got Started in Design?</h3>
      <p>
        → My journey into design began during the COVID-19 pandemic. With schools closed and a lot of free time on my hands,
        I started exploring online communities, especially on Discord, while playing games like Minecraft. I came across
        Minecraft servers that were looking for designers. At the time, I didn’t fully understand what a designer did,
        but I was eager to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first exposure to creative work came through uploading videos to YouTube, where I learned basic video editing
        and started designing thumbnails. Wanting to improve my professionalism, I began studying how to make more
        appealing and effective thumbnails. My interest deepened when I discovered texture packs for Minecraft, which
        inspired me to create my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, I began working as a designer for various servers and received positive feedback on my work. This
        experience helped me develop a strong foundation in graphic design and sparked a lasting passion for creativity
        and visual storytelling.
      </p>

      <h3>Current life situation (as of May 2025)</h3>
      <p>
        → I have recently completed my board examinations and am now using this transitional period to invest in my
        personal and professional growth. Currently, I am focusing on learning UI/UX design to broaden my skill set and
        gain a deeper understanding of user-centered design principles. In addition to UI/UX, I have mapped out a learning
        plan that includes exploring advanced tools and techniques in graphic design, web development, and 3D modeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my studies, I am actively looking for freelance or collaborative opportunities—not primarily for financial
        gain, but to apply my skills in real-world scenarios, gain hands-on experience, and enrich my portfolio. I strongly
        believe that practical exposure and continuous learning are key to becoming a well-rounded creative professional,
        and I am eager to contribute to projects where I can learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact.
